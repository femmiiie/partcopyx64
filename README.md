# partcopyx64
The following code is a C++ program that allows the user to copy a specified portion of a file to a physical drive using command-line arguments. The program takes four arguments in the following order:

The source path: The path of the file that needs to be copied.
The destination path: The physical drive where the file needs to be copied.
The start position: The byte offset from the beginning of the file where the copying should start.
The length: The number of bytes to be copied.
If the number of arguments is not exactly 5, the program outputs the correct usage format and returns an error.

The program first parses the command-line arguments and opens the source file using the ifstream object. It checks if the file was successfully opened and if not, it returns an error. It then opens the destination file (physical drive) using the CreateFile function from the Windows API. If the destination file could not be opened, it returns an error and closes the source file.

The program then sets the file pointer to the desired start position in the destination file using the SetFilePointer function. If this operation fails, it returns an error and closes both files. Finally, the program reads the specified number of bytes from the source file into a dynamically allocated buffer, and writes them to the destination file using the WriteFile function. If this operation fails, the program returns an error, deletes the buffer, and closes both files.

After the copying is complete, the program frees the allocated memory, closes both files, and returns a success status code.

Note that this program requires administrator privileges to run since it accesses physical drives directly. Also, it is intended for advanced users and should be used with caution, as it can potentially overwrite important data on the physical drive.
